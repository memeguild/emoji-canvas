# Emoji (Slack) Canvas

A simple tool for drawing pretty pictures using emoji.

## Developing

It is expected that you have the following installed:

* A relatively recent version of node (e.g. >= 5.0.0) and npm.
  * It is recommended that you install node using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
* Python 2.6 or 2.7, [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

Run `./scripts/bootstrap.sh` to create a python virtual environment and install the required node modules.

Once that completes you should be able to run `./scripts/run-server.sh` to start the flask server.

In another terminal, run `./scripts/watch.sh` to compile our CSS and JS down into the `/static` folder and watch for changes.
